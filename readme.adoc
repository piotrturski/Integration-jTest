Powerful & flexible testing lifecycle + opinionated defaults. +
<<docs/manual#,Reference documentation>>

### Integration tests made easy
No more:

- manual DB installation, setup or cleanup for local development
- single testing db shared between many devs
- separate db migrations and hibernate configuration for production and in-memory db
- untested stored procedures and committed transactions (due to always-rollback policy)
- problems with testing other kinds of storage (NoSQL, LDAP, search engine, queue, distributed FS, you name it)
- command line only tests that are painful to debug

### How would you test it?

Let's have a look at a typical repository that uses a little
bit more complex sql than all hello-world examples.
It's a typical spring-boot application with postgres and flyway.

.Application.java
[source,java]
----
@Repository class Repo {
    @Autowired JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

    /** fails at first batch containing null */
    public void save_ints_in_batches_by_two(List<Integer> ints) {
        jdbcTemplate.batchUpdate("insert into some_table values (?)", ints, 2,
                                                            (ps, value) -> ps.setInt(1, value));
    }

    public int count() {return jdbcTemplate.queryForObject("select my_count()", Integer.class);}
}

@SpringBootApplication public class Application {
	public static void main(String[] args) {SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);}
}
----

.V1__first_table.sql
[source,sql]
----
create table some_table (field integer not null);
----

.V2__function_and_data.sql
[source,sql]
----
-- this function just counts rows of some_table
CREATE FUNCTION my_count() RETURNS bigint AS $$ select count(1) from some_table; $$ LANGUAGE sql;

-- we often need some starting data. e.g. dictionaries
insert into some_table values (2);
----

- You can't test it using in-memory db - sql syntax won't match.
You need some real db to be started and prepared
- You can't test it using auto rollback as this code uses commits.

#### How would an ideal test look like?

Maybe we would like to write something like this:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootTest @RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
public class RepoTest {
    @Autowired Repo repo;

    @Test public void should_insert_all_values() {
        repo.save_ints_in_batches_by_two(Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5));

        int count = repo.count();
        assertThat(count).isEqualTo(5);
    }

    @Test public void should_fail_on_batch_containing_null() {
        assertThatCode(()->
                    repo.save_ints_in_batches_by_two(Arrays.asList(1,2,3,null,5))
            ).hasCauseInstanceOf(Exception.class);

        int count = repo.count();
        assertThat(count).isEqualTo(2);
    }
}
----

Buuut what about installing and starting postgres?
What about clean-up between tests? What about connection parameters?

What about...

Yep, you'll need to solve all those problems.
Using Integration jTest you'll do it in 20 lines of code.

#### Let's get started

[source,groovy]
----
testCompile 'net.piotrturski.integrationjtest:postgres:0.0.1-beta'
----

[source,java]
----
import net.piotrturski.integrationjtest.postgres.Postgres;
...
Postgres.docker("my-project", "9.6.1").run();
----

This line will run postgres docker image in version 9.6.1
(or connect to your local postgres instance if you have one)
and prepare `test` schema (or other if you override the default).

One more thing is missing. Integration jTest tries to be framework agnostic so
we have to connect it to spring-boot and JUnit. In this case we'll do it
by setting connection parameters as
system properties and preparing db before each test and before
building spring context:

.CommonDbTest.java
[source,java]
----
public class CommonDbTest {

    @BeforeClass public static void beforeClass() { prepareDb(); }
    @Before public void before() { prepareDb(); }

    static void prepareDb() {
        Postgres.docker("my-project", "9.6.1")
                .with(exposeDbPropertiesForSpringBoot)
                .run();
    }

    static PartialDefinition<PostgresConf> exposeDbPropertiesForSpringBoot = def ->
                def.postConfigure(runtime ->
                        ImmutableMap.of(
                                "spring.datasource.url", runtime.getConfig().getJdbcUrl(),
                                "spring.datasource.username", runtime.getConfig().user,
                                "spring.datasource.password", runtime.getConfig().passwd)
                                .forEach(System::setProperty));
}
----

Make your db tests extend `CommonDbTest` and that's it.
Now you can run your test from IDE, console or CI server.

To fully understand what's going on, check <<docs/manual#,documentation>>.
You will find out that similar strategy applies to other
testing frameworks, non-spring environments or non-db storage types.

### Free for small projects

It's free for up to 20 calls per build. Even for commercial use.
So you can:

- quickly start a project that requires storage tests
- easily evaluate if Integration jTest is a good fit for your existing project of any size
- use it for your studies or pet projects
